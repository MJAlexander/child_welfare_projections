This app shows the preliminary results of a projection model of foster care outcomes by state in the United States.

The projections are based on a Bayesian hirerchical state space model. In brief, foster care entries are modeled as a function of a set of demographic, socioeconomic, health and welfare variables (shown in the 'Covariates' tab). The association between each of the variables is allowed to vary across geography (census division) and time.
